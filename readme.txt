Gutenberg block in place of CiviCRM shortcode

## Description

CiviCRM uses shortcode in order to insert dynamic content into WordPress pages, such as Petition, Survey, Contribution form, Membershipâ€¦

As mentioned into the [CiviCRM documentation](https://docs.civicrm.org/sysadmin/en/latest/integration/wordpress/):
"Currently there is no specific CiviCRM block for Gutenberg so there is no interactive way to see the options available for the shortcode.
You will need to know the format and look up IDs and options in CiviCRM before creating the shortcode in WordPress."

Knowing an object ID is not very convenient. So we've made a plugin which uses the CiviCRM API to get and display all attributes for the shortcode, directly in a simple block.

This way, embedding CiviCRM content into any WordPress page becomes a child's play!

## Installation

1. Install, activate and configure CiviCRM (if not done yet)
